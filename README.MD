# SQL Notes & Examples

This repo contains my personal SQL notes and examples as Iâ€™ve progressed from beginner to advanced topics.  
It includes real-world style queries covering filtering, aggregation, joins, subqueries, window functions, and data wrangling.

## Contents
- **Intro to SQL**: SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, LIMIT  
- **Aggregations**: COUNT, SUM, MIN/MAX, AVG, GROUP BY, HAVING  
- **Conditional Logic**: CASE WHEN, NULL handling  
- **Joins**: INNER, LEFT, RIGHT, FULL OUTER, Self-Joins  
- **Set Operators**: UNION, UNION ALL

## Why?
I built these notes as part of my learning journey with SQL and data analysis.  
They serve both as a reference and as a showcase of my ability to write clean, optimized SQL queries.
